**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Many new concepts and coding tricks were utilized in building this site/app. Almost every element is responsive and moves based on the size of the browser or screen. One of my biggest struggles was combining an icon in svg format with the text inside of the edit button to make the colors match in the "hover" effect. I am not sure why, but for a while I could not make them both transition into the darker font. Eventually i figured out where i went wrong and now they match up perfectly. Another struggle was getting the border-line above the footer to match in length to the one on the top. I must have missed which element to attach it to and couldnt get it to move according to the margin that i had created around the page. Many attempts were made before i finally landed on the correct location and settings for this to work.
  
**Figma**  
  
  In order to create proper dimensions and import certain icons into my project, I relied on the prebuilt project in Figma. I went back and forth quite a bit, perfecting everything. 
  
  Certain elements were not able to be pulled so I had to eyeball certain colorations and opacities.

**Images**  
  
 In order to make my project function better, without lag, I compressed the images [here](https://tinypng.com/), which made the project load faster and easier to manipulate the elements. 
  

**Git Bash** 
This was the first project where I utilized nano inside of Git Bash in order to code some elements of the project. The footer was completely designed inside of nano as well as certain elements of other blocks. This was very interesting and made me feel like a hacker.

**Github**
My initial submission was an accident and I submitted an empty project which I promptly corrected. This will be my second submission since then.

**Conclusion**
In spite of certain frustrations and repeated mistakes, this was my favorite project from TripleTen thus far. Here's to many more and happy coding!
